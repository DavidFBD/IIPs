## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
A defined BIP-44 path for derivation of ICON addresses from mnemonic seeds.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
BIP-44 is the standard that describes the derivation paths that Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets (as defined in BIP-32) can use to derive wallet addresses. It structure defines *levels* in the paths to define *coin types*, *accounts*, *chain (change level)* and *addresses*, using different paths when deriving wallets from mnemonic seeds will result in different addresses and for this reason each blockchain defines a path to be used as the standard when generating wallet addresses in their chains.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for IIPs that want to change the ICON protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. IIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Creating an standard for the BIP44 `coin_type` and derivation paths for ICON wallets will allow for compatibility for wallet generation based on mnemonic seeds across the ICON ecosystem. The benefit of this are the following:

* Allow backup compatibility between wallets that generate addresses based on mnemonic seeds.
* Create a seamless user experience in web apps that allow for users to login or sign transactions with ledger devices or any other Hierarchical Deterministic wallet.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current ICON platforms.-->
This specification describes the following derivation paths:

* **Standard derivation path:** This derivation path uses the guidelines described in the [**BIP-44**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) and [**SLIP-44**](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) to maintain the ICON Ecosystem in line with the industry standards and should be the one used for generating new ICON wallet addresses.

* **Legacy derivation path:** This derivation path purpose is to maintain backwards compatibility for ICON addresses generated by ICONex via Ledger devices.

Developers of Hierarchical Deterministic wallet in the ICON Ecosystem should use the **Standard derivation path** to generate new ICON addresses to their users and use the **Legacy derivation path** as an option when importing a mnemonic seed to allow backward compatibility.

Developers of web applications that have an interface for user login via ICON wallets should present both **Standard** and **Legacy** derivation paths to allow the users to choose from.

The following is the path levels described in the [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) specification.

`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`

Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.

As defined in BIP-44 `purpose` is a constant set to `44'`, this document defines the values for the subsequent levels (`coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`).

### Path levels for Standard and Legacy.

* **Standard**: With a `coin_type` of `74'`, *hardened derivation* for `account'` and *non-hardened* derivation for `change` and `address_index`. (example of initial path: `m / 44' / 74'/ 0' / 0 / 0`).
* **Legacy** with a `coin_type` of `4801368'` and *hardened derivations* for `account'`, `change'` and `address_index'`. (example of initial path: `m / 44' / 4801368'/ 0' / 0' / 0'`)

### Account Discovery

The general recommendation is to follow the specifications described in the [Account discovery section of the BIP-44 document](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#account-discovery), which described the process to generate multiple accounts with one master seed and multiple addresses for each account.

For general purposes and for the sake of simplicity this document recommends the use of the following levels in the path for both **Standard** and **Legacy** paths and derive systematically by increasing the level `address_index` as follow:

* **Standard**:  `m / 44' / 74'/ 0' / 0 / {index}`
* **Legacy**:  `m / 44' /4801368'/ 0' / 0' / {index}'`
## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All IIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The IIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. IIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for IIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other IIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any IIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the IIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
